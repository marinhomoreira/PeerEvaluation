		p You must fill the following form with a letter grade assessment of each (including yourself) of your group members' contributions to the current assignment (Iteration 0) together with a 1/3 page-length description of that person's contribution justifying your assessment. <strong><u>It is not acceptable to give everyone in your group an A or to give everyone in your group an F. A report that does not reflect the dynamics of the group will be considered a failure, which could cause you to fail the course.</u></strong> It is your responsibility to get to know your group members and know their contributions to the project.
